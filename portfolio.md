Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using Scikit-learn. The model was trained on a publicly available dataset that included various health indicators. Before training, I performed data preprocessing and feature selection to enhance model performance. I experimented with several classification algorithms and found that Logistic Regression provided the best results, achieving an accuracy of 88.52% in predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not.

**Technologies Used:**

-   Python
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   Scikit-learn
-   Pandas
-   Numpy
