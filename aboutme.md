### Hello

I'm Josh Crotty, a student at South East Technological University [(SETU)](https://www.setu.ie/) 
in Co. Waterford, Ireland. Currently pursuing a B.Sc in Software Systems Development with Honors, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences. Beyond my academic endeavors, I serve as the Student Representative for my course, facilitating communication between students and department faculty to foster a supportive learning environment.

### My Work and Interests

My interests span across various domains of technology, including web application development, machine learning, and data analytics. I enjoy exploring new technologies and methodologies that drive innovation and efficiency in software development.

### Education and Future Aspirations

I'm in my final year of my undergraduate degree and look forward to completing my B.Sc in Software Systems Development with Honors by May 2025. Post-graduation, I hoping to pursue an M.Sc in Data Science & Analytics at University College Cork, where I aim to open my expertise in data-driven application development and predictive modeling.

### Additional Interests

I like traveling because for me it is getting to know new people and learning about their culture and background. Another aspect of the excitement is exploring new cities and the countryside.
