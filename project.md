## **Project Description**

Cognify is a cloud-based AI system designed to analyse MRI images and detect signs of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) using deep learning techniques. This system leverages Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to provide a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for researchers and healthcare professionals.
To ensure optimal performance, multiple deep learning models are trained and compared. A variety of hyperparameter tuning strategies are explored to improve accuracy and robustness. The models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, AUC-ROC, and F1-score. This project will focus on the comparison of selected models along with the effects of augmentation and transfer learning, compiling, and analysing each of the metrics to determine an effective architecture for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease classification.

Additionally, sample MRI images from the ADNI dataset are showcased below to illustrate the type of data used in the project. The final report detailing the methodology, results, and findings is available below.
